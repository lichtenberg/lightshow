WELCOME!

This repository contains a multi-strip LED controller intented for art projects.

You can choreograph LED animations via MIDI, which makes it easier to synchronize
them to audio or MIDI tracks maintained in audio packages such as Logic Pro.

It runs on an Arduino MEGA 2560.

The basic LED animations are derived from the great ALA Arduino library, but are not
forked from there.
